            <p>Hello! I didn't see you there. Of course I didn't. That's not how this works. Anyway, my name is Marcus
                and today it's my job to tell you a little bit about myself. Here are some facts: I am a human. I live in Portland, OR.
                I am learning to code. In fact, that might be what you see before you. Most folks refer to me as "he/him". I have strong
                opinions about animals. So strong, I have created two lists for you: Animals that are totally sick, and animals that we 
                can probably get rid of because what are they for, anyway?
            </p>

            <h2>FUN FACT:</h2>
            <p id="fun-fact">
                In 1998 I was a state finalist for the National Geographic Bee. I grew up in rural Nevada so there wasn't really a lot
                of competition. When I went to the state finals in Las Vegas, I got my first question wrong and failed out of the first round. I was
                so devastated I vowed never to look at a map again.
